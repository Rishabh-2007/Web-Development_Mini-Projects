      <h4>First Glimpse: The Fort Awaits</h4>
      <p>The moment Surat Fort came into view, I was genuinely impressed. Coming from Mumbai, where old structures are either demolished or lost in concrete jungles, seeing a fort this
well-preserved was refreshing. The massive structure stood clean and imposing, radiating an energy that immediately told me this wasn't going to be a boring history lesson.</p>

        <h4>The Weapons That Told Stories</h4>
        <p>The weapons section was my favourite. Massive swords displayed behind glass - some easily five feet long - made me wonder about the warriors who wielded them. There were intricately designed daggers,
old muskets, and even chainmail Armor. The cannons, both inside and displayed in the courtyard with huge iron balls beside them, were silent reminders of battles that once raged here.        </p>

        <h4>Ancient Sculptures and Artistry</h4>
        <p>What truly mesmerized me were the stone carvings. The museum had an incredible collection of Buddha statues in serene meditation poses, Hindu deities carved with such precision that every detail - from jewellery to facial expressions - was visible even after centuries.           </p>
